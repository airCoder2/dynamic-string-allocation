# dynamic-string-allocation
This code takes arrays of strings (strings) as arguments and dynamically allocates the necessary memory.

Advantages:
1. There is no predefined size of the string array. It initially allocated memory for one, then reallocates if needed.

Restrictions:
1. The string should be only 10 - 1 characters long.
2. The string should not contain any whitespaces.
